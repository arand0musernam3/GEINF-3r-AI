# For solving this practic exercise you will need to use:
#   python programming language 
#   pandas library (pandas.pydata.org) -> Tutorial ... http://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html
#   sikit-learn library
#
# Is recomended to use anaconda (www.anaconda.com) and use built in spyder IDE.
# As with a single instalation all the required libraries will be instalated.
# All computers in the laboratory has this optin and others (pycharm...) already installed


#1) Load the starwars dataset as a pandas dataframe. (1 point)



#2) Inspect de dataser. How many intstances and variales there are in the original dataset? (1 point)



#3) Let's imagine we want to create a model that predicts the homeworld of a character.
# Do you think that all the variables are relevant? Wich ones are important and wich ones are not in our case.
#If some of them are not relevant delete them. Give the reason why you delete the variables. (1 point)



#4) In datamining, statistics, and mathematics we can talk about predictor variables (X) and predicted/objective variables (y).
#Split the dataset in X and y datasets. (1 point)



#5)In datmining the model is trained with one datassed and tested with new unseen data. Prepare the train and test datasets.
# Which test % leaves sikitlear by default? Change it to use only 30%? (1 points)



#6) Build and train the DummyClassifier with strategy="most_frequent" and a GaussianNB models using the previously created Train datasets. (3 points)



#7) Compare the scores and conusion matrixes of the 2 models. Results are bad with both techniques.
# Naibe bayes is a probabilistic model predicts the most probable ansher acording to the training set.
# DummyClassifier with mostcommon strategy predicts allways the most common class seen in the training dataset.
# Visualize both confusion_matrix. And accuracy_score.
# Explain what's happening here. (3 points)



#8) Change the datasset and do the same steps for the bank dataset. Here both techniques get good results can you explain why? (6 points)
